# packaaaa

This code repository is the code for the Packer portion of the CYSE 492 Senior Design Project (Lockheed Martin Packer/Loader)

The follow dependencies are required to build:
```
flask 
pynacl 
pyopenssl 
requests
pysimplegui
config-with-yaml
numpy
```

To run
```
python Packer.py
```

Usage

1. Within the same directory as Packer.py, create a folder called `static`
2. Within this `static` folder, create a folder for a loader (name of folder should be ID of loader), and have a .txt file with the name of the loader (authorize the loader by placing its ID in authorized-ids.txt). 
3. Within this loader folder, any folders placed within will serve as payload folders. 2 files, details.txt and `secret-key` should be present. A secret key file can be generated by running ./Packer.py -g

Current Functionality:

* Able to send files to a requesting program
* Able to be run in adhoc https mode
* Able to compress files
* Able to encrypt compressed file
* Able to combine multiple encrypted, compressed files into a blob
* Blob metadata is written in the filename
* Contains a tester to test the blob decompression and decryption
* SSL Ready
* Generate secret keys
* Send "encrypted" argv and envp to payloads

todo:
Authenticate usage of api
